# git revert

revert command helps you undo an existing commit.
it doesn't delete any data in the process instead rather git creates new commit with the included files reverted to their previous state.
so, your version history moves forward while the state of your file moves backward.
when you revert a commit, a commit id is assigned to reverted commit

syntax:
$ git revert <commit_id>
